-- MAKE SURE TO RENAME THE DOWNLOADED ZIP FILE INTO PostCode (case sensitive) --  

If the verification/forget password process failed, make sure that the path/location of this downloaded and extracted folder is located in the correct path as the one inside 

PostCode\PostCode\include\send_password_mail.php as well PostCode\PostCode\include\verification_mail.php

When you extract this folder, make sure that there are a PostCode/ folder inside an outer PostCode/ folder, and it contains all the files inside.

If you have registered successfully/the verification e-mail has been sent, but when you tried to verify it when clicking the link in the mail sent, it results in a 404 page, it means that there is probably something wrong with your folder path (still incorrect). If you do not wish to move folders, just change both links/paths of the phpmailers to be the current path of your localhost, please make your own adjustments!
